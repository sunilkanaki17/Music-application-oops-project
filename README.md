# Music Application

## Overview
The **Music Application** is a basic music player that implements core functionalities such as user authentication, music library management, and search capabilities. This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create a modular and extensible system.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** 
  - Users can sign up with a username and a strong password.
  - Password strength criteria: At least 8 characters, including one symbol, one digit, one uppercase letter, and one lowercase letter.
  
- **Music Library Management:**
  - Manages a collection of songs stored in a text file (`songs_file.txt`).
  - Features include displaying available songs, showing lyrics, and searching for songs by artist, name, rating, or genre.

- **Search Functionality:**
  - Users can search for songs based on artist name, song name, rating, or genre.

## Project Structure
- **main.cpp:** Contains the main function and integrates all components of the music application.
- **User, Song, FileHandler, MusicLibrary, MusicManager classes:** Implements the core functionalities of user management, song representation, file handling, music library operations, and user interaction management.
- **songs_file.txt:** Text file containing details of songs used by the application.

## Conclusion
This music application demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in building a music player. By utilizing concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, the project offers a modular and extensible system. The application features user authentication, comprehensive music library management, and robust search capabilities, providing users with a seamless music listening experience.
